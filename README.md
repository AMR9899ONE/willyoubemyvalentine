## 💌 A Letter from My Heart

My dearest love,

Like Totoro watching over the forest, I watch over you with endless care. Just as lilies bloom with grace and beauty, you've brought color and fragrance into my world. Every day with you is a scene from the most beautiful Ghibli film.

あなたは私の世界を明るくしてくれる ✨  
*(You light up my world)*

## 🎬 Our Love Story (Studio Ghibli Style)

> *"When you fall in love, it is a temporary madness. It erupts like an earthquake, and then it subsides. And when it subsides, you have to make a decision. You have to work out whether your roots are to become so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part."*

Our story is like:
- 🌲 **My Neighbor Totoro** - You're my magical discovery, my wonder
- 🏰 **Howl's Moving Castle** - My heart belongs to you
- 🌊 **Ponyo** - I'd cross any ocean for you
- ✈️ **The Wind Rises** - You make my dreams take flight
- 🌸 **Spirited Away** - You've enchanted my soul
